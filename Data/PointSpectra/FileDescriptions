Each point file contains the spectrum taken at different points on the same
film. These are *not* point spectra of the films we are looking at, because
I did not think to save point spectra at the time. These are point spectra
of a 2D perovskite film containing n-butylammonium lead iodide and 
phenylethylammonium lead iodide. `
