Filenamed as topo is misleading! All are hyperspectral images, i.e images that contain a IR spectrum at each pixel. 

256x256 pixels
Film12topo_0026 was taken April 6. Integration time 300 ms, see corresponding txt file for more information. Scan angle 0 deg
Film12topo_0058 taken April 9. Integrationtime 300 ms, seee corr. txt file for more information. Scan angle 3 deg

depending on the scan angle.
