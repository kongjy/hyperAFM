Detailed derivation of where the total photoinduced force equation comes from. I can do up through equation 4 and think that eqns 5, 6, and 7 are just some more fancy algebra (Levi-Civita tensor and Dirac Deltas, in different notation), so there's probably no need to derive through all 7 equations, unless you really want to.
